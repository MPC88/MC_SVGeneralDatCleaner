# MC_SVGeneralDatCleaner

Function
========
If you install and unlock a ship mod, its ID is saved in General.dat.  If you later uninstall that ship mod, the ID being present will cause issues when selected a ship on new game start.  
  
This tool allows you to delete ship entries from Star Valor's General.dat file.  
  
The tool displays ship IDs as this is the only information available from the general.dat file.  Ask the ship mod creator for the ID if it has not been provided.  

Install
=======
Download MC_SVGeneralDatCleaner.zip and extract the contents to any directory.  
  
Use  
===  
1. Make a backup of your general.dat file (found at .\Star Valor\Star Valor_Data\general.dat).
2. Run MC_SVGeneralDatCleaner.exe.  
3. Point the application to the folder containing Star Valor.exe.  
4. Click "Load general.dat".
5. Select an ID from the list, click the red cross or press the delete key.
6. Click "Save general.dat".
7. Exit.  
  
Either the save location must be .\Star Valor\Star Valor_Data\ or you must place the saved file there after creating it.
